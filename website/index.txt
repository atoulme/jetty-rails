h2. What

See the "what is included":rdoc/files/History_txt.html in the last version.

Jetty Rails aims to run any Warbler based JRuby on Rails or JRuby Merb applications with Jetty Container, loading configuration from Warbler.

This project is useful for people developing JRuby on Rails (or Merb) applications that can not use mongrel for development. Rails and Merb applications integrated with servlet based applications in the same context would be a reasonable reason.

The project has born from my own needs ("read more":http://fabiokung.com/2008/05/14/jetty-rails-gem-simple-jruby-on-rails-development-with-servlet-containers/). I needed to run "JForum":http://jforum.net on the same context of my jruby on rails application. I had also to integrate @HttpSessions@ (avoiding single sign on) and use @ServletContext@ in-memory cache store.

h2. Installing

<pre>jruby -S gem install jetty-rails</pre>

h2. The basics

Jetty Rails uses Jetty Handlers to dispatch requests to the "JRuby Rack adapter":http://wiki.jruby.org/wiki/JRuby_Rack. 

All extra jars inside your application lib/ dir will be loaded. Things like Java @HttpSession@, @ServletContext@ and Runtime Pools are given by JRuby Rack Filter.

h2. Demonstration of usage

Rails:
<pre>
cd myrailsapp
jruby -S jetty_rails
</pre>

Merb:
<pre>
cd mymerbapp
jruby -S jetty_merb
</pre>
  
--help option shows usage details:
  
<pre>jruby -S jetty_rails --help</pre>
<pre>jruby -S jetty_merb --help</pre>

Please note that you may only use Merb with ActiveRecord, as DataMapper doesn't work in JRuby yet.
